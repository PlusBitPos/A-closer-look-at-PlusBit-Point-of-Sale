# **A closer look at PlusBit Point of Sale**

## **Problem statement**

So far, POS systems were being built using custom hardware, making them costly and less flexible. A new trend is emerging now. Business owners have started using tablets and smart phones as their POS terminals. PlusBit POS is an app based on Android platform, used by merchants and vendors for processing cryptocurrency payments. Make your tablet or smart phone Point-of-Sale (POS) system with PlusBit. 

PlusBit is designed for merchants to be able to accept cryptocurrencies quickly, easily, and securely. In order to further adoption of cryptocurrency we need to make it easy for merchants to accept it as a form of payment. This system will enable them to do so.

PlusBit eliminates the involvement of a third-party processor, allowing merchants to accept payments directly from their customers within seconds, in a secured and trustless environment. The deployment of the PlusBit POS system is anticipated to bring blockchain-enabled payment technology to the mainstream, while keeping the transactions seamless and cost-free.

Unlike custodial processors, PlusBit does not store or withhold any funds of merchants. It is an entirely P2P payment solution, with the convenience and benefits of a payment processor. PlusBit does not have access to merchant’s private key and money goes directly to their cold wallet.

Moreover, PlusBit doesnot get any fee from transactions. There is no monthly fee for merchant. PlusBit is completely free mobile Point-of-Sale app for everyone.

## **Why use this instead of a mobile wallet?**

For merchants, using a wallet to accept coins is NOT a good solution. First of all, you don’t want co-workers to have access to wallets so you will want a receive only option. PlusBit offers this solution. It is a fully non-custodial, easy to set up and charges no fees… You are the only person to have 100% control over your or your company’s funds. PlusBit only generates the payment requests to a wallet that the merchant controls on a different machine. This means that there is no control of the coins from the POS software. This situation works especially well when you have employees that may access this machine as well. 

With PlusBit, your keys and funds remain in your control at all times. Your private keys never need to be entered into PlusBit. That makes using Plusbit pretty safe. Nobody will have access to any of the funds you receive at any time.

One of the other reasons a merchant would use this app over the standard mobile wallet would be to have an experience they are familiar with. It has been designed to be very closely related to credit card processing machines in this respect.

You don't need to wait wallet sync.
